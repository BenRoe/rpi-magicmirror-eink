  == Hardware connection ==
    EPD    =>    Raspberry Pi
  * VCC    ->    3.3
  * GND    ->    GND
  * DIN    ->    MOSI
  * CLK    ->    SCLK
  * CS     ->    24 (Physical, BCM: CE0, 8)
  * D/C    ->    22 (Physical, BCM: 25)
  * RES    ->    11 (Physical, BCM: 17)
  * BUSY   ->    18 (Physical, BCM: 24)
